        <h4 class="privacy__body-header"><b>Search Leakage</b></h4>
        <p class="privacy__body--info">At other search engines, when you do a search and then click
            on a link, your search terms are sent to that site you clicked on (in the <a
                    href="https://looksmart.com/?q=HTTP referrer header">HTTP referrer header</a>).
            We call this sharing of personal information "search leakage‚Äù, For example, when you
            search for something private, you are sharing that private search not only with your
            search engine, but also with all the sites that you clicked on (for that search). In
            addition, when you visit any site, your computer automatically sends information about
            it to that site (including your <a href="https://looksmart.com/?q=user agent">User
                agent</a> and <a href="https://looksmart.com/?q=IP address">IP address</a>). This
            information can often be used to identify you directly. So when you do that private
            search, not only can those other sites know your search terms, but they can also know
            that you searched it. It is this combination of available information about you that
            raises privacy concerns. Orion prevents search leakage by default. Instead, when you
            click on a link on our site, we route (redirect) that request in such a way so that it
            does not send your search terms to other sites. The other sites will still know that you
            visited them, but they will not know what search you entered beforehand. <br><br>At some
            other search engines (including us), you can also use an encrypted version (HTTPS),
            which as a byproduct doesn't usually send your search terms to sites. However, it is
            slower to connect to these versions and if you click on a site that also uses HTTPS then
            your search is sent. Nevertheless, the encrypted version does protect your search from
            being leaked onto the computers it travels on between you and us.</p>
        <a class="anchor"></a>
        <p class="privacy__body--info">At Orion, our encrypted version goes even further and
            automatically changes links from a number of major Web sites to point to the encrypted
            versions of those sites. It is modeled after (and uses code from) the HTTPS Everywhere.
            These sites include Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon to name a few. Another way
            to prevent search leakage is by using something called a <a
                    href="https://looksmart.com/?q=POST request">POST request</a>, which has the
            effect of not showing your search in your browser, and, as a consequence, does not send
            it to other sites. You can turn on POST requests on our settings page, but it has its
            own issues. POST requests usually break browser back buttons, and they make it
            impossible for you to easily share your search by copying and pasting it out of your Web
            browser's address bar. <br><br>Finally, if you want to prevent sites from knowing you
            visited them at all, you can use a proxy like <a href="https://looksmart.com/?q=Tor">Tor</a>.
            Orion actually operates a <a href="https://looksmart.com/?q=Tor exit enclave">Tor exit
                enclave</a>, which means you can get end to end anonymous and encrypted searching
            using Tor & DDG together. You can enter !proxy domain into Orion as well, and we will
            route you through a proxy, e.g. !proxy breadpig.com. Unfortunately, proxies can also be
            slow, and free proxies (like the one we use) are funded by arguably excessive
            advertising. Because of these drawbacks in HTTPS, POST and proxies we decided to take
            the redirect approach to combat search leakage. However, we leave the choice up to you.
            You can deviate from the default on our settings page by toggling the redirect or
            address bar settings. You can also use our encrypted version.</p>

        <h4 class="privacy__body-header"><b>Search History</b></h4>
        <p class="privacy__body--info">Other search engines save your search history. Usually your
            searches are saved along with the date and time of the search, some information about
            your computer (e.g. your IP address, User agent and often a unique identifier stored in
            a <a href="https://looksmart.com/?q=browser cookie">browser cookie</a>), and if you are
            logged in, your account information (e.g. name and email address). With only the
            timestamp and computer information, your searches can often be traced directly to you.
            With the additional account information, they are associated directly with you. Also,
            note that with this information your searches can be tied together. This means someone
            can see everything you've been searching, not just one isolated search. You can usually
            find out a lot about a person from their search history. It's sort of creepy that people
            at search engines can see all this info about you, but that is not the main concern. The
            main concern is when they either a) release it to the public or b) give it to law
            enforcement. Why would they release it to the public? AOL famously released supposedly
            anonymous search terms for research purposes, except they didn't do a good job of making
            them completely anonymous, and they were ultimately. <br><br>The other way to release it
            to the public is by accident. Search engines could lose data, or get hacked, or
            accidentally expose data due to security holes or incompetence, all of which has
            happened with personal information on the Internet. Why would search engines give your
            search history to law enforcement? Simply because law enforcement asked for it, usually
            as part of a legal investigation. If you read privacy policies and terms of service
            carefully you will notice that they say they can give your information on court order.
            This makes sense because they may be legally obligated to do so. However, search engines
            are not legally obligated to collect personal information in the first place. They do it
            on their own volition. The bottom line is if search engines have your information, it
            could get out, even if they have the best intentions. And this information (your search
            history) can be pretty personal. <br><br>For these reasons, Orion takes the approach to
            not collect any personal information. The decisions of whether and how to comply with
            law enforcement requests, whether and how to anonymize data, and how to best protect
            your information from hackers are out of our hands. Your search history is safe with us
            because it cannot be tied to you in any way.</p>

        <h4 class="privacy__body-header"><b>Information Not Collected</b></h4>
        <p class="privacy__body--info">When you search at Orion, we don't know who you are and there
            is no way to tie your searches together. When you access Orion (or any Web site), your
            Web browser automatically sends information about your computer, e.g. your User agent
            and IP address because this information could be used to link you to your searches, we
            do not log (store) it at all. This is a very unusual practice, but we feel it is an
            important step to protect your privacy. It is unusual for a few reasons. First, most
            server software auto-stores this information, so you have to go out of your way not to
            store it. Second, most businesses want to keep as much information as possible because
            they don't know when it will be useful. Third, many search engines actively use this
            information, for example to show you more targeted advertising. <br><br>Another way that
            your searches are often tied together at other search engines are through browser
            cookies, which are pieces of information that sit on your computer and get sent to the
            search engine on each request. What search engines often do is store a unique identifier
            in your browser and then associate that identifier with your searches. <br><br>At Orion,
            no cookies are used by default. In response to efforts by the EFF and others, the major
            search engines have begun "anonymizing" their search log data after periods of time.
            Sure, this is better than not doing so, but you should note that this does not make your
            search history anonymous in the same way that it is at Orion. What search engines
            generally do when they anonymize data is get rid of part of your IP address or turn it
            into something that doesn't look exactly like an IP address and they do the same thing
            for uniquely identifying cookies. However, in many cases, this so-called anonymous data
            can still tie your searches together, which can be used to reconstruct who you are and
            what you searched for. Additionally, search engines usually are silent on what they do
            with the User agent, which has been shown to also have enough information to often be
            personally identifiable, especially if isolated to a particular search session (day).

        <h4 class="privacy__body-header"><b>Information Collected</b></h4>
        <p class="privacy__body--info">At Orion, no cookies are used by default. If you have changed
            any settings, then cookies are used to store those changes. However, in that case, they
            are not stored in a personally identifiable way. For example, the large size setting is
            stored as 's=l'; no unique identifier is in there. Furthermore, if you prefer not to use
            cookies to store settings, you can use URL parameters instead.
            <br><br>We do not use any third parties to do the code insertion, and we do not work
            with any sites that share personally identifiable information (e.g. name, address, etc.)
            via their affiliate programs. This means that no information is shared from Orion to the
            sites, and the only information that is collected from this process is product
            information, which is not tied to any particular user and which we do not save or store
            on our end. It is completely analogous to the search result case from the previous
            paragraph--we can see anonymous product info such that we cannot tie them to any
            particular person (or even tie multiple purchases together). <br><br>This whole
            affiliate process is an attempt to keep advertising to a minimal level on Orion.
            Finally, if you give us feedback, it may be stored in our email. However, you can give
            anonymous feedback (by not entering your email or other personal info on the feedback
            form).

            else, we will comply with court ordered legal requests. However, in our case, we don't
